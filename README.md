# Raspberry-Pi-Access-Control

The Raspberry Pi will read a card, check if it is authorized, and release the 3D printer for use.

This code requires the SPI-Py extension installed from https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py.
The MFRC522.py class is the work of mxgxw from https://github.com/mxgxw/MFRC522-python.
